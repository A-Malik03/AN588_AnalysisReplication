The columns' headings indicate the predictors used in the three models investigating encounter probability and termination. 
Each line represents each instance the focal party is in a given cell. 

"enc.ID" indicates the unique ID of an inter-community encounter;
"dur.in.cell" indicates the time that the focal party stays in a given cell; 
"community" indicates the community followed;
"encounter/split" indicates whether an encounter occurs or whether the two communities travelling already together split; 
"marginality" indicates the marginality value of the cell when only one community is present (non-encounter), 
and the maximum marginality value between the two communities when both communities are together in the cell (encounter). 

The predictors "difference in party size", "number of maximally tumescent females", "difference in number of maximally tumescent females" 
and "fruit abundance index per cell" are square root-transformed, 
the "Morisita's Index" is log-transformed, 
and all predictors are z-transformed. 
Missing data are reported as NA.
